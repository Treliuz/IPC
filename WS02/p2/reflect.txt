1. The reason that price1 converted to its cent value is innaccurate is due to the fully expanded float value being 
	imprecise then truncated into an interger and not being properly rounded thus displaying as 1795 instead of 1796.
2. These examples work properly mainly due to the fact that (double) is being casted on either or both interger values 
	that implicitly promotes the values in the operand to a floating-point value precise enough for the division operation 
	to be conducted with out issue or imprecisions.
3.
  a) The value of 'result' is 72. Since we are dividing with 2 intergers they will end up truncating any decimal or fractional value. 
  b) 1. $0.00
	 2. $72
	 3. $0.00
	 4. $72
  c) The fact that samples 1 and 3 don't work properly, indicates that when using the printf function its important to be using the correct
		format specifiers so that it can properly handle conversions and coercions when handling operations or the result of an operation.
